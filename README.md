# devops-nextjs-static-analysis

The companion repository for my article Static Analysis, the first step in any application. It uses a NextJS typescript application as an example
of how to setup linting and automation to check the code on every commit and push to a PR.

## Setup

Use nvm to setup the correct version of nodejs.

```
nvm install
nvm use
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
